MineSweeper orginally created in 1990 by microsoft as a single player computer game. This game follows the same style of rules and outcome. The Main goal of the game is to correctly figure out where the bombs are located on the board without hitting there locations. This is mainly done logic and at time partly guessing (depending how good you are). The game supplies the player with a numer which referes to the numer of near by bombs. From thi information the player can work out which locations are safe and which have a hidden bomb. If the board is completed the player get a nice WELL DONE! message.

Additonally, a timer could be added. Creating a sense of urgiency in the game. Also this means a highscore section could be added with the fastest time compleition.
