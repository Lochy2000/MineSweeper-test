MineSweeper orginally created in 1990 by microsoft as a single player computer game. This game follows the same style of rules and outcome. The Main goal of the game is to correctly figure out where the bombs are located on the board without hitting there locations. This is done through through logic and part guess at times. The game supplies the player with a numer which referes to the numer of near by bombs. From thi information the player can work out which locations are safe and which have a hidden bomb. If the board is completed the player get a nice WELL DONE! message.
